#VisaTime AI – Milestone 1

##Data Collection & Preprocessing

###Project Overview

         VisaTime AI is an AI-powered system designed to estimate visa processing times using historical H-1B disclosure data.

###Milestone 1 focuses on:

              -Data cleaning
              -Missing value handling
              -Feature engineering
              -Outlier treatment
              -Preparing a training-ready dataset
This stage transforms raw disclosure records into a structured dataset suitable for machine learning.

##Dataset Description

Source: H-1B Disclosure Data (Public Government Dataset)
Initial Size: 79,999 records × 11 columns
After Preprocessing: 78,400 records × 8 columns

###Key Features Used:

            -application_date
            -decision_date
            -visa_type
            -occupation_category
            -wage
            -worksite_state
            -processing_center (derived proxy)
            -processing_days (target variable)

##Objective of Milestone 1

To create a clean, realistic, and model-ready dataset for predicting visa processing time.

##Preprocessing Steps Performed
###1️⃣ Date Standardization

-Converted application_date and decision_date into datetime format.
-Removed invalid or corrupted date records.

        Ensures correct time-based calculations.

###2️⃣ Target Variable Creation
        processing_days = decision_date - application_date

This represents the number of days taken for visa decision.

###3️⃣ Removal of Unrealistic Durations

Kept records where:
        -Processing days ≥ 1
        -Processing days ≤ 240

  Removes appeal cases and abnormal records.

###4️⃣ Missing Value Handling
      -Numerical:Wage values filled using median imputation

      -Categorical:Missing vales replaced with "UNKNOWN"

 Prevents unnecessary row deletion.

###5️⃣ Outlier Treatment

Removed extreme wage values using 1st and 99th percentile filtering.

Improves regression stability.

###6️⃣ Feature Engineering
Seasonal Features:
          -Extracted month
          -Extracted day_of_week
Processing Center Proxy
          -Since real USCIS service center information is not available in disclosure data, a proxy was created using geographic state mapping.

Captures regional workload variation.

###7️⃣ Encoding

Applied Label Encoding to categorical variables:

                 -visa_type
                 -occupation_category
                 -worksite_state
                 -processing_center

Converts text features into numeric format for ML models.

###8️⃣ Normalization

Applied Standard Scaling to wage feature.

Prevents scale dominance in regression models.

##Final Training Dataset
